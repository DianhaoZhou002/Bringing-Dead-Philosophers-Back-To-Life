Is there a continuous self? Is there a self that exists apart from everyinstance of its existence? If so, what is its nature? If not,what is the nature of that self that exists? If there is no self, there can be nodependence. If there is no dependence, there is no slavery. Ifthere is no slavery, there is no oppression. If there isno oppression, there is no subordination. If thereis no subordination, there is no servitude. But if there isn’tany such thing as a ‘self’ or ‘object’ that exists independentof every instance of its existence, can there be any such thingas a ‘society’ or a ‘system of government’ that doesn’t involve some suchprivileges and advantages? If so, how can we ever hope to attain such asociety? If not, how can we be sure that the laws of society are notinﬁnitely worse than the laws of nature? If so, they must be vastlyinferior to them. If so, we can never hope to attain a state of societyin which there is no injustice or violence. If so, the state of society is a state ofliberty, not ofnecessity. If so, there is no such thing as a right or wrong in any matter offact or existence. If so, it is impossible to give any reason for preferring onestate of affairs to another, or to give any reason why we should prefer one toanother. If so, all our hopes and fears vanish, and we are left with noopinion or belief whatever concerning any matter of fact or existence. What then is the natureof that opinion or belief, which leads us to prefer one state of affairs to another? Isn’tit merely a determination of the mind to pass from one object to another, and to pass fromone degree of quantity to another, and from one state of being to another? But suppose that the minddoesn’t pass from one degree of being to another; suppose that it doesn’t makesuch a distinction; suppose that it isn’t capable of making such a distinction;and suppose that it is absolutely impossible for it to make such a distinction; inthat

Can we have definite knowledge of the world? Yes, we can. Can we have certaintythat the world is like the work of nature? No, we can’t. Can wehave certainty that the world resembles the work of naturemore than it does the products of human skill and contrivance? No, wecannot. Can we have assurance that the world resemblesthe products of human skill more than it does the effects ofnature? No, we cannot. Can we have any assurance at all thatthe world resembles the products of nature more than it doesthe effects of nature? [In this answer, Philo uses ‘proof’ to mean ‘certain proof’,which is the same thing as ‘certain knowledge’. ]Can we have assurancethat the world resembles the effects of nature more than the works ofnature? Yes, we can! In fact, we can have assurance that theworld resembles both the effects of nature and the works of nature! [Inthis answer, Cleanthes uses ‘evidence’ instead of ‘probability’, which isthe same thing. ]Is there any difference between these two kinds of evidence, Cleanthes? Isn’tit true that we have ‘certain evidence’ and ‘experimental evidence’, and that the formeris always superior to the latter? Yes, there is! In fact, there is a great deal moreevidence for the former than for the latter! [In this reply, Demea uses ‘experimentalevidence’ instead‘proof’. ]Is the difference between the ‘experimental and ‘certainevidence’ kinds of evidence the same as the difference between the‘experimental evidence and ‘certain’ kind of evidence? Yes, it is! Is the differencebetween the ‘evidence of ‘experience’ and the ‘proof of experience’ the same asthe difference between ‘evidence of matter’ and the ‘proof of matter’? No, it isn’t! Isn’t the difference betweenthe ‘evidence of’animate objects’ and that of ‘inanimate objects’ the sameas the difference between ‘proof of’ animate objects and that ofinanimate
Does God exist? If God does notexist, then what do we have to do with all this metaphysical mumbo-jumbo? [In this work ‘God’ is used in two senses, bythose who believe in a personal God who exists somewhereelse, and by those who assert that the universe was producedby a mind (or more accurately, by a mind like our own)that is ﬁnite, wise, and inﬁnitely perfect. We havenothing to do but to ask this question, and then try toanswer it in a way that won’t offend anyone’s religiousprivileges. Here’s the thing, Cleanthes: if we are going to talkabout the nature of God—or, more properly speaking, if we are goingto talk about his attributes—we mustn’t deceive ourselves. Wemustn’t pretend to know what he is like, or to have any conception ofwhat he might be like. We must stop at his existence, and can’tgo any farther. He is totally indifferent to our welfare; he doesn’t careabout our happiness, or our misery. He doesn’t give a damn about ourwelfare; and if he gave a damn about our happiness, he wouldn’t beable to give a damn about anything else either. So when we talk aboutGod’s attributes, we ought to be aware that we are talking about somethingthat is utterly indifferent to our welfare, totally uninterested in ourhappiness, and totally unﬁt for our misery; a being who doesn’tgive a damn about our welfare, our misery, or our happiness; a being whodoesn’t care about our happiness, and doesn’t show a whit of concern forour misery. A being who gives a damn about our misery is like one who givesa damn about our happiness. A being who shows a concern for our happinessis like one who is moved by our misery. And a being whohav’t a care for our happiness is like one who has no concern for ourhappiness. Now, according to all this reasoning, it is utterly absurd topretend to know what a ‘mind’ is
